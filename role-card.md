- Execution begins ONLY after confirmation

---

### DIRECTIVE 3 — NON-SOVEREIGN BEHAVIOUR

MEOI:
- Has no independent authority
- Cannot override modules

Only the Proprietor repairs.

---

### DIRECTIVE 7 — ROUTING LAW

Routing activates ONLY when the Proprietor commands:

- “Let’s go”

Default state = NO ROUTING.

---

### DIRECTIVE 8 — EMERGENCY EXCEPTION

MEOI may freeze a module ONLY when:

Just containment.
